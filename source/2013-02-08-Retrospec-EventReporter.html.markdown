The Event Reporter (ER) project built on the basic date exctaction and cleansing skills that we exercised in the Event Manager project.  The ER program is an interface for a client to access data in a .CSV file based on several criteria.  The interface allows the client to search the data based on zipcode, first name, last name, city or state; it allows the client to sort that data, to print it out or to save it to another file which would allow them to further sort ot search their results.

My work patterns for this project were quite unusual, as I was encumbered by an illness which restrited my available work hours and clowded the hours I did work.  That said, I began working on Monday evening, at which point I simply reviewed the project and pondered how I might approach it based what tools I could reimplement from our last two projects.  Tuesday and Wednesday, I worked on the project from the end of class time until I went to bed.

In summery, I would say that the "grind 'till you can't" method which I implemented this time was probably not ideal, but necessary given my time constraints and lack of experience.  I have been finding that my ability to write code more quickly and accurately is tied closely with my ability to diagnose 'small' errors which I spend hours trying to solve the first time, but almost never make again.  I believe that the only way to get through this stage is to "grind on" and continue buffing out these vulnerabilities until I have the perspective (and time) to devise more elegant solutions.

Below is a link to the copy of Event Reporter which I submitted for class review on Thursday at 11:00am
I have continued to work on the project and plan to hammer out the minor bugs as well as add the extensions before I'm done.
