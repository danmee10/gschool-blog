It has been one month since gSchool started.  In that time, we have completed three projects, ranging from a few days in length to two weeks.  At this point we have been exposed to many of the fundamental aspects of the Ruby programming language, and are relatively competent in the structuring of data retreival systems.

While I feel like these accomplishments are huge strides to have made in only 4 weeks, I still feel like I have more to learn before I can confidently go out and develop something of value on my own.  The understanding of the back-end data handeling systems, that are the foundation of any computer application, has given me an incredibly valuable perspective on how these things work, and I am excited to apply that understanding to the development of web applications.

I made the decision to come to gSchool because I wanted to learn how to build websites.  The idea that I will have the power to construct an interface for customers of a business in any industry is extremely appealing to me as someone with a background in economics.  The visual aspect of the site as well as the functional and organizational aspects of the web design process are definitely the most appealing, which is why I am happy that our class began with an introduction to the back-end.  I am now sure that, having spent a substantial amount of time learning the side of this process that had pretty much no appeal upfront, I have made the right choice in making the move to this industry.
