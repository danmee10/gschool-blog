<!-- SalesEngine
What’s a technique that you’ve used in the project that was once totally opaque but now is clear?

What’s something that’s still confusing to you? Why?

How do you feel about testing with MiniTest? What about it makes your process harder? Easier?

Is working in a pair harder or easier than being by yourself? Do you feel like you’d be farther ahead or behind if you were on your own? Can nine women make a baby in one month?


Becoming a Developer
It’s been a long three weeks. Do you feel like a developer yet?

You have 21 weeks to go. What are you most excited about?

How has the class environment matched or differed from your expectations?

What resources are you relying on when you need support, and why? -->

The last three weeks have been spent grinding out a basic understanding of how programs are structured and the fundamentals of Ruby code and syntax.  We have had three main projects, two of them were team based and one was a solo venture.  The third of these, the Sales-Engine, also our current project, is quite a step up from the last two in size and scope of included concepts.

In the first two projects I found myself writing code to solve a seriese of related problems, without having to give an overwhelming amount of thought to the big picture along the way (although my code would have benefitted a great deal from this).  In the Sales-Engine project, the shear size and complexity of the problem, has been forcing me to expand my understanding of the small pieces and how they fit together, to how they function as a whole.

One thing that I have gotten much better at in this project, in addition to the way I think about projects as a whole, is using enumerators.  Any iterations in my first two projects were done with each, and those iterations were being run excessively.  In this project, I learned to use enumerators to create objects which could be used in other parts of my code, without having to re-iterate through the origional data.

On the flip side, one thing that I am still working on is developing effecient functional tests.  Developing a feel for the balance between trying to do too much, and not actualy doing anything is something that I will have to focus on as we rap up this project and begin working on future ones.

Now, despite the difficulty I have been experiencing with developing a "feel" for writing tests, there were multiple instances where they lead my partner and I to discover issues with our code that could have caused major trauma down the road had they gone unnoticed long enough.  Those instances, along with how writing them first forced me to think about the nature of the problem my code was trying to solve, left me with a positive impression of them as a whole and the desire to improve my ability to utilize them in the future.

Working in pairs certainly has its advantages.  I would say that motivation and "reality-checking" rank high among them.  It can be easy to make excuses for yourself when you feel like procrastinating or cutting corners, but when you know that someone else is relying on your performance, it is difficult to justify doing anything but your work.  In addition to the motivation factor, it is helpfull to have a second set eyes that understand and are invested to the big picture of what is being worked on.  Sometimes the most time-consuming blunders are the most easily solvable, as long as you are not the one making them.

At this point, while I have created things that work, I do not feel like I am "fluent" in the languages that would allow me to create anything I wanted.  That point is what I am most excited about reaching and so far, based on the pace we have been moving and the fluidity of communication between fellow students and instructors I assume that that point will be reached well before graduation.  

While I find myself relying on Google for the more simple questions relating Ruby syntax, which turns out to be the majority of my questions, other students have been enormously helpfull as they are on close to the same page and are always immediatly available.  For the "big" questions, the ones that no other student understands, the instructors are obviousy the go to.  Usually these questions can be addressed through flodock, but more complicated issues are solved in person.
