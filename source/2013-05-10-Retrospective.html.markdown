For the Feed Engine project, my team is building an inbox that unifies the information from their Gmail, Facebook and Twitter accounts.  It is definitely a cool idea for a time saver, but as someone who never uses Facebook or Twitter, I can't speak to how our target market might receive it.

My team began this project much like all my other teams began projects in the past: we agreed on a general work schedule and began writing stories in pivotal tracker.  Our main focus for effective and consistent progress will to be to keep test coverage high and the master branch clean.  We will pull to local branches where merge conflicts will be dealt with in a safe environment and review pull requests closely.
