Don't Make Me Think, does a good job of presenting some simple usability tips in a light hearted, entertaining way.  While the book is a bit dated in technological terms, the content is general enough that it still feels relevant.  Most of what is covered in the first 6 chapters feels pretty straightforward and obvious, but I still feel like I benefited from seeing it come from an experienced professional.
