Feed engine complete.  It was an ugly and perhaps ill-conceived project, but it worked goddamnit.  Who knew that most people wouldn't be willing to risk the security of all the information in their Gmail inbox for the ability to view their Twitter mentions in the same feed?  Not me.  When we started the project, I was underestimated how invasive it would be to save private emails to our database, if only for a short time.  I also did not appreciate that people viewed their twitter information differently than their emails.  It turns out that the general, almost time-killer nature of twitter information acted as little more than a distraction from the specifically directed emails.

I was a little dissapointed that we never got around to the front end. We decided as a team that our time would be better spent solidifying the functionality. I think we made the right decision here, as our product did what it was supposed to do, and the code that we wrote was clean and decently well tested.
