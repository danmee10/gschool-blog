So, with the issues that plagued the last project fresh on our minds, I think the whole class approached this extension with perfection as the main goal.  We ended up spending the first two days fixing the 100+ broken tests and getting the coverage up from 50% to just over 80%.  It does feel good having that stability under our feet as we push forward with the new features that have been assigned to us.

I actually like having the customer play a large role in the progression of the project.  That kind of feedback has helped keep us focused on what absolutely needs to be done, rather than having a long list of requirements which we need to figure out how to meet within the given time frame.  The smaller chunks are far easier to manage, and I feel like we are doing a much better job on the project as a whole because we aren't tempted to look too far ahead to try and combign tasks in the name of 'efficiency'.

Dispite all the problems that our class had with the last project, I learned more from it than I had from any other.  At this point the overall structure of rails and the way the pieces work together and share information is much clearer.  One of my weak spots is probably choosing how to structure the routing for a project.  I tend to get overwhelmed trying to make my life easier down the road and thinking too far ahead.  I have been having a hard time finding the discipline to ignore how these (and other) pieces might function down the road in order to produce immediate functionality (which in my mind still sounds like a bad idea).  I assume that as time goes on, these decisions will become more obvious the more I travel down the road.
