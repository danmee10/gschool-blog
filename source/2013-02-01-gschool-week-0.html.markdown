For the last 5 days, myself and 23 other young, prospective code-warriors, sharpened our brain-teeth on the first two of many projects that will be assigned to us over the next 6 months.  These projects, while small in scale, introduced us to several new concepts that I imagine will be the foundation for all projects to come.  Succeding in the production of two functional programs, through collaboration with the other members of the class, was incredibly satisfying.  So far, I have enjoyed the work we have done and I am looking forward to the challenges ahead of us.
