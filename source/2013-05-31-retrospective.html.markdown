I've been working on the solo project for about a week now, and I'm really enjoying the freedom of being on my own team.  It isn't that that I thought any of the teams I worked with in the past would have been unwelcoming to my ideas, but there is definitely something restrictive about having to worry whether a "risk" that looks appealing might hurt someone else's project.

It has also been nice not having definitive project specs.  After perusing ProgrammableWeb's API list for a while, looking for inspiration, I just started coding with a rough idea of what I wanted.  The process of trying something that I wasn't sure was possible exposed the boundaries of what I know believe is a feasible MVP given my ability and timeframe.

The other side of not having any teammates (nobody to help when things get tough) hasn't been an issue yet.  So far, the issues I've run into have been either easily resolved with the help of an instructor, or so large that they became one of the boundaries that helped me define my MVP.
