One week from two days before tomorrow, there will be an unraveling of the most profound leap forward in modern internet technology to date.

It would be impossible to describe any one of the infinite features of this gap, or "god-app", since each of them are infinitely complexed.  Also, since using this program will likely cause the frail human minds of any mortal user to collapse inwards, rendering them, with a great and unimaginable feeling of enlightenment and euphoria, in a vegetable state, only the truly divine will benefit from this outrageously awesome thing we are making now.

With all that said, there are a few things I would like to say about the process that has lead our team to this point...

Rails:
So far we have had to learn at least one new language, or system for every project we have done.  While rails and cucumber are not considered languages of their own, there are enough features that are unique to them that make following the TDD style of programming difficult and extremely time consuming.  It is starting to seem like TDD is important to rails apps, in that they help keep all the moving pieces in order.  I am looking forward, as I have been saying in just about every blog post to this point, to getting to where I am not so encumbered by my lack of experience, that I cannot focus on making what I am trying to make exactly what I want rather than something that works.

Pairing:
Good.  A perpetual battle between wanting to solve the problem my way, on my own, with no help from anyone, ever and knowing the value of understanding how someone else's mind works through a problem.  There is a great value in always having a second set of eyes, that are focused on the exact same problem.  I find pairing extremely stressful at times, because it can force me to explain what I am thinking about before I have collected my thoughts in a communicable form...if that makes any sense.  When solving problems, I sometimes like to do a rapid hack/test style, where I'm not 100% sure what's going to happen at any given time.  Having just written that it sounds terrible, but it (in varying degrees) has gotten me through some seriously complicated problems including the high level calculus and other assorted math classes I took back in college, so its hard to trash altogether.  So, I guess in closing, I recognize the value in pairing and think it could be good for me, but sort of HATE it.
