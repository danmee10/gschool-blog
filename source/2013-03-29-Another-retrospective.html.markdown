One week from two days before tomorrow, there will be an unveiling of the most profound leap forward in modern internet technology to date.

It would be impossible to describe any one of the infinite features of this GAp, or "god-app", since each of them are infinitely complexed.  Also, since using this program will likely cause the frail human mind of any mortal user to collapse inwards, leaving them in a vegetable state, with a great and unimaginable feeling of enlightenment and euphoria, only the truly divine will benefit from this outrageously awesome thing we are making now.

With all that said, there are a few things I would like to say about the process that has lead our team to this point...

Rails:
So far we have had to learn at least one new language, or system for every project we have done.  While rails and cucumber are not considered languages of their own, there are enough features that are unique to them that make following the TDD style of programming difficult and extremely time consuming.  It is starting to seem like TDD is important to rails apps, in that they help keep all the moving pieces in order.  I am looking forward, as I have been saying in just about every blog post to this point, to the point where I am not so encumbered by my lack of experience, that I can focus on making exactly what I want rather than assembling something that works.

Pairing:
Good.  A perpetual battle between wanting to solve the problem my way, on my own, with no help from anyone, ever and knowing the value of understanding how someone else's mind works through a problem.  There is a great value in always having a second set of eyes, that are focused on the exact same problem.  I find pairing extremely stressful at times, because it forces me to explain what I am thinking about before I have collected my thoughts in a communicable form...if that makes any sense.  When solving problems, I sometimes like to do a rapid hack/test style, where I'm not 100% sure what's going to happen at any given time.

Having just written that, I realize that it sounds terrible, and I'd like to stress to all potential employers reading this that while I haven't always been 100% sure what was about to happen, I did all things humanly possible to ensure that what I was "testing/hacking", could not cause a catastrophic failure, and that when things did happen I gained a better understanding of how the thing I was working on operates.

So, I guess in closing, I recognize the value in pairing and think it could be good for me, but sort of HATE it.
