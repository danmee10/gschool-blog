So ends Store Engine.  It was a long, hard fought battle, but I feel that we emerged victorious...well, mostly.  Store Engine was our first major rails app with a significant front end, and while my team did not end up having an abundance of time to play with different visual layouts and features, it was nice to have something visual to appreciate at the end of the project.

As I already mentioned, my team was a bit pressed for time and did not get a chance to really experiment with additional features, or play with multiple design options as I would have liked to.  This was a result of our having a lower combined experience level than some of the other teams.  While this was definitely a disadvantage in terms of what we were capable of producing, I don't think it had an impact on how much we learned from the project.  In fact, I think that because all three of us were at a similar level of inexperience, it pushed us to learn more than we would have had there been someone with significantly more experience on the team.

Coming into this project, I knew it was going to be a challenge to learn rails while trying to manage team dynamics and putting together what was required of us.  I knew it was going to be difficult because it was difficult learning sinatra and SQL for the last project and because it was difficult getting used to ruby for the projects before that.  The issue of learning to do something while learning how to use the tools necessary to do it at the same time was very much a factor for this last project, and I am looking forward to our first project where we use tools that we are already familiar with.
