So, the teams presented their DoSE projects yesterday, and the results seem to have been an improvement over the SoSE projects.  I think the whole class approached this project with a more professional expectations, and it resulted with cleaner and more functional code.  If we had another two weeks on the code, I don't think I would change much of anything about how we approach whatever new features we would implement.  I might use the testing suite more...I think that I forgot we actually had tests this time around since we did them all upfront and didn't run them as much as I should have, but I don't see that as something that will be hard to get used to.

Our team did not make any substantial changes to the routing structure of the existing code, and I did not gain any clarity on that particular weak spot this time around.  I did, however, get to practice a substantial amount of jQuery.  I think that the jQuery I wrote, while functional, has a lot of room from improvement, and I look forward to being able to refactor it and make it a more efficient tool.
