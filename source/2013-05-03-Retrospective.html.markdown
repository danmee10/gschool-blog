So, the teams presented their DoSE projects yesterday, and the results seem to have been an improvement over the SoSE projects.  I think the whole class approached this project with more professional expectations, and the resulting code was cleaner and more functional.  If we had another two weeks on the code, I don't think I would change much of anything about how we approach whatever new features we would implement.  I might use the testing suite more...I think that I forgot we actually had tests this time around since we did them all upfront.  I imagine that I will get more used to actually having tests in the comming projects...

Our team did not make any substantial changes to the routing structure of the existing code, and I did not gain any clarity on that particular weak spot this time around.  I did, however, get to practice a substantial amount of jQuery.  I think that the jQuery I wrote, while functional, has a lot of room from improvement, and I look forward to being able to refactor it and make it a more efficient tool.
