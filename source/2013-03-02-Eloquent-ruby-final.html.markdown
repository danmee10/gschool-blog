Eloquent Ruby did a good job of expanding my understanding of some of Ruby's core concepts.  Throughout the book, there was a good mix of theory with specific code examples.  I never found myself wondering what a method being discussed actually looked like in practice for too long before I came across an example.  The examples themselves were nested within rich explinations of their use and strategic applications.  The first couple of sections of the book were probably the most helpful, as they covered the topics that I already had a decent understanding of.  These secitons opened my eyes to new uses for these familiar methods and their overall functions, but even when I read about concepts that I didn't understand, I could gather enough about why they were important to want to come back later.

At this point, I feel like there were many such concepts that went over my head, but the way the information was presented definitely got me interested.  I look forward to being able to re-read these sections down the road when I will have had sufficient experience to pick up on the finer details of what Russ is talking about.

I would definitely recommend this book to someone who is atleast where I'm at in terms of Ruby experience, but I think it would benefit someone who is a litte further along more. As I mentioned above, I feel like I got the most out of the sections of the book which covered information that I was the most familiar with.  The sections which covered less familiar material were great, in that they got me excited for what lies ahead, but probably won't be terribly usefull in the short-term.
