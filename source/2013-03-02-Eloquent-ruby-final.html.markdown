We turned in Traffic-Spy yesterday.  This project introduced us to both web frameworks and databases, and having constructed a functional product, I feel pretty good about what my partner and I accomplished.  I should say though, the actual web site which displayed the information we were tasked with gathering and sorting, was hideous, there is no denying that.  After getting familiar with sinatra and postgres, we simply had no time to try and figure out enough html and css to make our site display anything more than raw data.  I expect, our next book "html & css", will give me the information I need to make my next project a bit more professional looking.

As I mentioned above, this was our first project using a database, so while my team did manage to build a functional app, I wouldn't say that I have a complete understanding of them.  For me, the leap from having a file containing all the data that my program needed, to having that data stored in some dark, far-away corner in the bowels of my computer, was pretty significant.  At this point, I would say knowing how and where to specify which database to use is what I am still a bit unclear on, but I think that I will be able to get that straigtned out before the end of the next project.
