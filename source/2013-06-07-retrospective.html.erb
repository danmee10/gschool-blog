The individual projects were due yesterday, and I definitely wish we had had more time.  In the end, I did not get the app to a point where it was presentable, but I enjoyed working on it all the same.  The project I picked definitely pushed my limits as a developer, as I was forced to do more javascript than I ever had previously.  The amount of time it took me to get the UI features up and running definitely forced me to compromise the cleanliness of my core rails app; I believe that this was the reason that I was not able to trouble-shoot the issues that arose when I tried to deploy to Heroku.

I do not regret choosing this project, however ambitious it may have been.  In my eyes, the ultimate goal for this project was to learn and I definitely succeeded there.  I don't think I would have learned quite as much if I wasn't as excited about the project, and I would certainly not have learned about all the things that I tried and that ultimately led to my not finishing.

I intend on continuing with this code base for my final project and look forward to cleaning up the rough spots that were left in the interest of UI features and adding the UI features that I didn't get around to.
