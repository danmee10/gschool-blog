This past week has been a bit of a slower paced refresher, where we revisited some ideas that we met in previous projects.  Specifically, we remade Sales Engine with the sinatra web framework.  As an excercise, this remake definitely gave me a better understanding of how the connections between the data sets of sales engine work, as well as the different pieces of a web app.  It was nice to be able to approach these concepts without the deadlines that were imposed on our first run through.  The more relaxed setting allowed me to take time and think about the overall structures more as I went through, since I didn't need to keep my head down and churn out functionality.

Overall I would say that it was a good experience, and that it added a lot to my understanding of the last two major projects we worked on as teams.
